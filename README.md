Objective

The goal of this exercise was to build an environment that can distract an attacker from real assets and one that you can gain insight into the attackers activities and tactics. Particularly,to build a knowledge base of SSH and Telnet emulation, attack logging, and file emulation from the stand point of a security professional. Also,from a more general standpoint, the ability to spin up a virtual environment and build on it using a code repository like github.  

Skills Learned

Gained a better understanding of the functionality behind a honeypot, not just the benign environment, but the tools used to capture and anaylize attack behavior like capturing date and time, ip address, and shell commands. Also, learned how to take advantage of existing code and a repository like github.  

Tools Used
