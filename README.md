FIREWALL

Objective

The Firewall project is the culmination of the Forage Telstra Cybersecurity Job Simulation. Given firewall logs and some back ground on the Spring Framework vulnerability the aim of the exercise was to diagnose, triage, alert, and ultimately address the threat by changing the firewall rules, or in this case build a firewall with a python script. A general outline of the Firewall and the Attacker's code were provided. Overall this simulation provided a real-world incident and response scenario to provide insight into the role and responsibilities of a Security Analyst. 

Skills Learned

Advanced understanding of Firewall concepts and practical application.
Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting firewall logs.
Ability to recognize attack signatures and patterns.
Effective communication including a incident report. 

Tools Used

Pycharm was used to run the provided attackers code, to create an HTTP server, and to create the firewall.
